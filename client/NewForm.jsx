//page renders upon button click from Splash page, is child of Splash, receieves props of USER ID (or checks session from browser??) 
//page is a child of splash, contingent on react router 
//form will contain:
	//input text field for each of the following:
  	//what is the problem?
		//what did i expect to happen
    //what have i already tried
    //why i suspect its not working
		//solution

	// drop down menu containing clickable fields/buttons <-- research how to include a checkbox
		//may contain a set of booleans, if yes, if no
	//boolean checkbox of whether or not the bug has been solved


//upon clicking submit, make sure there is content in each field
  //then send post request to backend to add all 4 text fields with either array of tags, or new key on object, include USERID
